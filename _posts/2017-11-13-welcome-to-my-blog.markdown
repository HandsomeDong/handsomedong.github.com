Hi everyone. I am Shengdong Lu. I spended three days on building this blog on top of jekyll.

The reason I made this is that I feel that I always forget the knowledge that I have learnt. I was thinking that sharing may be a good way for me to preserve those knowledge. Also, rephrasing them help me to digest and understand them.

I hope this blog will help you too.

Best,

Shengdong
